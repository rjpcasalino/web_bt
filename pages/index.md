### Hi, I'm Ryan Casalino. 
I am a programmer. This is my small part of the internet. There are many like it, of course, but this one is mine. I like simplicity over complexity. I believe anyone with half a brain and a willingness to learn can become a computer programmer, a keyboard cowboy, a stream samurai, etc, etc and so on in that fashion.

> ## [Hire me!](mailto:jobs@boringtranquility.io)

### Hire you? I don't even know you!
Yep, you're right on that score!
A bit more about me:
I enjoy all manner of books be they technical, derivative, trivial or otherwise. 
I collect O'Reilly Media's color-coded [Animal Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Reilly_Media#/media/File:ACM_OReilly-Rainbow-large-flash.jpg). I place them, as if trophies, throughout my apartment. Much to my wife's chagrin, I am sure.
I am a self-taught programmer. I might have more to say sometime later. 
I enjoy starting sentences with the word <span>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;</span>I<span>&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</span>

### Stuff I do / Stuff I've done
>> #### Pinocchio
>
> Single Page Application written using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) with Vue Router and Vuex for state management during my time at GawkBox. This replaced a Sails application.
>> #### Tintin
>
> Go backend written to facilitate data communication between aforementioned Vue SPA. Allowed authentication with YouTube, Twitch, and Mixer. Handled user updates such as profile changes (e.g., avatar updates, bio changes etc). Communicated with a MySQL database.
>
>> #### Shadow 
>
> Ruby written service that utilized [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) to send messages to a front end dashboard.
>
>> #### Mayday
>
> Admin portal written in Go that communicated with a PostgreSQL database. Allowed users to alter records for given enterprises (hotels, in this case) as well as that enterprise's assets (panic buttons).
>
>> #### Chairman
>
> I helped maintain this Ruby of Rails application that served as the backbone for a life safety application akin to Life Alert<span>&TRADE;</span>. I worked to update the Rails version and optimized the code base.
>
>> #### Gadfly
>
> A simple service that sent operations staff notifications via Slack / allowed said staff to preform certain operations against database with Slack commands. 
>
>> #### Odyssey
>
> A hastily written static site generator in Python (I used it to generate this site!). It's in need of much refinement.

- I've written [RESTful](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm) APIs.
- I've worked with many [AWS](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/BSoD_in_Windows_1.0.png) tools including but not limited to: EC2, SNS, S3, SQS, Lambda, et al.
- I'm also very familiar with both Google's and Microsoft's cloud computing offerings. Azure and GCP.

#### Tools I use (and like)

- [vim](https://www.vim.org/) - I learn something new about it almost every month.
- [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/) - my daily drivers are NixOS, Debian, and [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/).
- Numerous [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) for a multitude of personal projects (they're great fun!)
- I self-host this and other websites on those credit card sized servers using [nginx](https://nginx.org/) and [apache](https://www.apache.org/).

- I really really really miss Mac OS X!

#### Tools I use and don't like
- Microsoft Windows
> Word and Excel and PowerPoint and other Microsoft programs have intimate — one might say promiscuous — knowledge of each others' internals. In Unix, one tries to design programs to operate not specifically with each other, but with programs as yet unthought of.
