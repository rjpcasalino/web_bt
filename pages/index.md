### Hi, I'm [Ryan Casalino](mailto:jobs@boringtranquility.io).<span>&#128406;</span> 
I'm a programmer with a passion for all things related to the web and, yep, I sometimes write raw HTML (e.g.,`<br>`). I'm into the POSIX standard. What else? I like reading books and among my favorites are [Rabbit Redux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_Redux), [The Art of Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morihei_Ueshiba), and [UNIX: A History and a Memoir](https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-History-Memoir-Brian-Kernighan/dp/1695978552). I'm big into self-hosting and this website is hosted on "bare metal" in my home in Seattle, WA. I use nginx and NixOS (and some magic) to get it done.

Here are some quotes I really enjoy and sum up my views on software programming:

> The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements. 
>> <span>&mdash;</span>Brian Kernighan

> The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination.
>> <span>&mdash;</span>Fred Brooks

> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
>> <span>&mdash;</span>Martin Fowler

### /usr/bin
#### (works) 
>> #### Pinocchio
>
> Single Page Application written using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) with Vue Router and Vuex for state management during my time at GawkBox. This replaced a Sails application.
>
>> #### Tintin
>
> Go back end written to facilitate data communication between aforementioned Vue SPA. Allowed authentication with YouTube, Twitch, and Mixer. Handled user updates such as profile changes (e.g., avatar updates, bio changes etc). Communicated with a MySQL database.
>
>> #### Shadow 
>
> Ruby written service that utilized [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) to send messages to a front end dashboard.
>
>> #### Mayday
>
> Admin portal written in Go that communicated with a PostgreSQL database. Allowed users to alter records for given enterprises (hotels, in this case) as well as that enterprise's assets (panic buttons).
>
>> #### Chairman
>
> I helped maintain this Ruby of Rails application that served as the backbone for a life safety application akin to Life Alert<span>&TRADE;</span>. I worked to update the Rails version and optimized the code base.
>
>> #### Gadfly
>
> A simple service that sent operations staff notifications using the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/) which allowed staff to preform limited operations against database with Slack commands. 
>
>> #### [Odyssey](https://git.sr.ht/~rjpcasalino/odyssey)
>
> A static site generator written in Python (I used it to generate this site!).
