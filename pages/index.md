## Hi,
My name is Ryan Casalino. This is my small part of the internet. There are many like it, of course, but this one is mine. 

No, I did not create the Levitating, Meditating, Flute-playing Gnu. This is the work of [Aurélio A. Heckert](https://www.gnu.org/graphics/meditate.html) which is a modified version created by the Nevrax Design Team.

There are things you should now beforehand...

I think it's amazing what the [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) can do! 

### Things I do / Thing I've done
- I've written web applications using [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) (a Python micro-framework). 
- I've written [RESTful](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm) APIs using JavaScript(node), Go, Python, and Ruby.
- I've worked with many [AWS](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/BSoD_in_Windows_1.0.png) tools including but not limited to: EC2, SNS, S3, SQS, et al.
- I'm also very familiar with both Google's and Microsoft's cloud computing offerings. Azure and GPC.
- I've worked at two startups and two mid-sized companies. 

### Tools I use 
__I enjoy Open Source software as well as Free Software__

- I love [vim](https://www.vim.org/) and I learn something new about it almost every month.
- I'm a proponent of [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/) but I also use [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) as a desktop.
- I have utilized numerous [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) for a multitude of personal projects (they're great fun!)
- I've self-hosted this and other websites on those credit card sized servers using nginx and apache.
- I've played around with Docker both on the job and at home. Wonderful fun it was.
- I use GNU Screen and i3

Here's the core of it and I'll quit yapping:
