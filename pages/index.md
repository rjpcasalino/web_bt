### Hi, I'm <a href="mailto:ryan@boringtranquility.io" rel="me">Ryan Casalino</a>.<span>&#128406;</span> 
I'm a programmer that's more of a rambler in the groves of academe than a serious student. I read comparatively little. I try to understand as best I can most everything I put my mind to. I more often than not come up short. I feel we can sometimes enter a boring tranquility of sorts wherein little is ventured and much less else is gained. In the realm of $WORK, I tend to fallback to intellectually certified individuals:

> The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination.

> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
