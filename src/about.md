Hello!

I was born in New York City and raised in Brooklyn. I've been a computer nerd since I first got my hands on a [Power Macintosh 6100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_6100). Marvelous how one can recall the old machines of youth. From then on I was an "Apple fanboy" as a certain subset of humans were once known. I even wrote some articles in a silly online journal devoted to all things Apple and Macintosh and aptly named "Macteens".

Nowadays, I'm a self described Software Programmer. I'm not an Engineer as I hold no degree in engineering blessed by academia. I didn't study computer science in school either outside of the one class that taught us how to interact with the free web space the institution had allotted us. We download an FTP client called Transmission and we'd upload HTML. Things I'd been doing in high school and things I, being in an [art school]() wanted to get away from. 

These were my wilderness years. Days of drawing and painting and writing as any decent artist would.

Chicago stretched across to New Orleans, and into the real world of IT work. I managed a fleet of servers at American Apparel stores in both Chicago and New Orleans. These servers ran "mission critical" software for the Point of Sale staff. Machines would fail and I'd fix them. I'd install new software etc ad infinitum. These were Windows boxes.

After some time of fixing broken servers and desktops I taught I could teach people how to use a new startup's educational software. Thus I spent 5 months at a startup that had the support of Venture for America, Andrew Yang's organization to help small businesses with talented young people. I wasn't part of VA but I worked along side some of where. It was an amazing adventure learning that I had zero desire to help people learn how to use a time and attendance system. I guess it showed because I wasn't offered the full time role. Lucky for me otherwise I would never had met my wife. But that's a tale for a different web page.
