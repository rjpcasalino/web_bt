I'm a rambler in the groves of academia more so than a serious student. I'm a self-disciplined programmer that takes pride in that fact. I've tinkered with computers joyously my entire life. I went to the [School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_the_Art_Institute_of_Chicago) to obtain a BFA. In college I wrote HTML, painted, wrote poetry and verse, watched classic [Hong Kong cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Better_Tomorrow), and generally had a wholesome time. After the stint in the Midwest I moved down to the American South, living in New Orleans and later Atlanta. I fixed computers and wrote code all along the way.
