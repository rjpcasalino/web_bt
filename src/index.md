God bless Newspeak and this controlled insanity. We owe it all to those wonderful Thought Police. I am boring you. <span>&#x1F927;</span> sorry, but might I interject?

I will see you all in Room 101. This feels like cliffsnotes. That's what they'll say, but hey, I'll see them down by the bay. Well, I just may. Remember, only give the warning <span>&#x262A; &#x1F54C;</span> That is all. Good things are coming.

Let me explain this story about how blacks came from glory _<span>&#8230;</span>_:

> _I was [Teddy Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_of_Theodore_Roosevelt) once, [2Pac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTFo0VKnNZY) too. I've been poets, madman, endless creatures so varied. I've been [Frank Sinatra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1_GHY7Sydc). I've slunk it out and been taken for a fool. Brandished guns in far off suns sharing deserts with [C.W. Sughrue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Crumley)._

> _I've sung ballads with [Ernst R<span>&ouml;</span>hm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_R%C3%B6hm) (just keeping it real and true), pondered long hours with [W. E. B. Du Bois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois), danced with [Billy Joel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xgjtm4_M20) at Shea on that last day, and confused myself on a day with [Cameron Frye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StUpDf_LA5g)._ 

I am only human. Cast away _oldthink_ and meet me @ the _joycamp_ and we'll misunderstand together.
