### Hi, I'm <a href="mailto:ryan@boringtranquility.io" rel="me"> just another "Winston Smith" cruising the metaverse for lovers and friends</a><span>&#x1F647;</span>

From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of Big Brother, from the age of doublethink

> _crimestop_, in short, is protective stupidity.

> Stupidity is never enough. We are required to know that black is white (_blackwhite_) and forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by a system of thought called _doublethink_.

> God bless Newspeak and this controlled insanity. We owe it all to those wonderful Thought Police. I am boring you. <span>&#x1F927;</span> sorry, but might I interject?

> I will see you all in Room 101. This feels like cliffsnotes. That's what they'll say, but hey, I'll see them down by the bay. Well, I just may. Remember, only give the warning <span>&#x262A; &#x1F54C;</span> That is all. Good things are coming.

> _I was Teddy Roosevelt once, 2Pac too. I've been poets, madman, endless creatures so varied. I've been Frank Sinatra. I've slunk it out and been taken for a fool. Brandished guns in far off suns sharing deserts with C.W. Sughrue._

> _I've sung ballads with Ernst R<span>&ouml;</span>hm, danced with Billy Joel @ Shea, and confused myself on a day with Cameron Frye._ 

I am only human. Cast away _oldthink_ and meet me @ the _joycamp_ and we'll misunderstand together.
