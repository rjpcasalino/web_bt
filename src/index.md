### Hi, I'm <a href="mailto:ryan@boringtranquility.io" rel="me">Ryan Casalino</a>.<span>&#128406;</span> 

> _To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men are different from one another and do not live alone<span>&mdash;</span>to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone. From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of Big Brother, from the age of double think

I'm more a rambler in the groves of academia than a serious student. I read comparatively little.

I'm a largely self-disciplined programmer that takes pride in that fact. I've tinkered with computers joyously my entire life. I went to the [School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_the_Art_Institute_of_Chicago) to obtain a BFA. In college I wrote HTML, painted, wrote poetry and verse, watched classic [Hong Kong cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Better_Tomorrow), and generally had a wholesome time. After the stint in the Midwest I moved down to the American South, living in New Orleans and later Atlanta. I fixed computers and wrote code all along the way.

I enjoy quoting people I think may have a better way with words than I:

> "The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements." 
>> <span>&mdash;</span>Brian Kernighan

> "The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination."
>> <span>&mdash;</span>Fred Brooks

> "People that quote other people are fools."
>> <span>&mdash;</span>Vanderbilt graduate I worked with in New Orleans who was very affable and clearly very wise.

> "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."
>> <span>&mdash;</span>Martin Fowler
