> Stupidity is never enough. We are required to know that black is white (_blackwhite_) and forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possiable by a system of thought called _doublethink_.

I am a rambler in the groves of academia more so than a serious student. I am a self-disciplined programmer that takes pride in that fact.

I went to the [School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_the_Art_Institute_of_Chicago) to obtain a BFA. While there, I wrote HTML, painted, wrote poetry and verse, watched classic [Hong Kong cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Better_Tomorrow), and generally had a wholesome time. After my time in that most American of cities, I moved down to the American South, living in New Orleans and later Atlanta. I fixed computers and wrote code all along the way.
