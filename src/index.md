### Hi, I'm <a href="mailto:ryan@boringtranquility.io" rel="me">Ryan Casalino</a>.<span>&#128406;</span> 
I'm more a rambler in the groves of academia than a serious student. I read comparatively little. I once harbored daydreams of becoming a college professor. This daydream would have had to have been the result of some technical mystical machine with the ability to send one back in time somewhere smack in the middle of the 19th century. Preferably nestled away in some college in the Northeast. Alas, 'tis but a dream. 

Outside of daydreams I'd say I'm a largely self-disciplined programmer that takes pride in that fact. I've tinkered with computers joyously my entire life. I went to the [School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_the_Art_Institute_of_Chicago) to obtain a BFA. In college I wrote HTML, painted, wrote poetry and verse, watched classic Hong Kong cinema, and generally had a wholesome time. After the stint in the Midwest I moved down to the American South, living in New Orleans and later Atlanta. I fixed computers and wrote code all along the way.

I enjoy quoting people I think may have a better way with words than I:

> "The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements." 
>> <span>&mdash;</span>Brian Kernighan

> "The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination."
>> <span>&mdash;</span>Fred Brooks

> "People that quote other people are fools."
>> <span>&mdash;</span>Vanderbilt graduate I worked with in New Orleans who was very affable and clearly very wise.

> "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."
>> <span>&mdash;</span>Martin Fowler
